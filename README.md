## Abstract
This thesis expands the theory and mathematical foundation behind the ex-
istence of short-lived explosive trends in the financial markets, split into the
explosion of the volatility and explosion of drift as first described in Chris-
tensen et al. (2016). We add finite sample corrections and extra parame-
ter tuning to the estimators, allowing us to improve the detection of periods
with extremely high volatility and possibly drift. With fast computational
algorithms, we create thorough simulation studies showing that these periods
cannot be described by the standard Heston model with a jump component.
However, we also provide evidence that conclusions drawn from the Heston
model does not necessarily extend to financial markets, particularly S&P 500.
To remedy this, a thorough study of volatility is conducted. The empirical
behaviour of volatility is investigated and volatility is modelled utilizing Brow-
nian semi-stationary processes as introduced in Barndorff-Nielsen & Schmiegel
(2009) in an attempt to capture both roughness and persistence along with
intraday seasonality.<br>
Ultimately, the simulation study is extended to a model featuring a Brownian
semi-stationary process, which strengthens the hypothesis of the existence of
the short-lived explosive periods as even such models fall short of explaining
these extreme events, denoted as bursts. This allows us to show the presence
of bursts on S&P 500 but question whether drift bursts are present or the
bursts are in fact all explained by an explosion in the volatility. We also apply
the theory on Bitcoin and justify the existence of both volatility bursts and
drift bursts in this market, though high-frequency frictions on the exchanges
make these conclusions uncertain.
